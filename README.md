# ApeCoin UI

## Getting Started

You will need an [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and API key. They are free so go get one and then create a `.env.local` file with the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the site by modifying `app/page.tsx` or whatever files you're trying to modify. The site will auto-update as you save changes to files.
